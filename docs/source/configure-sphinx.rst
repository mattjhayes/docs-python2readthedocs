Configure Sphinx
################

This guide is for configuring Sphinx on Ubuntu.

In the root directory of your project (replace <PROJECT_NAME> where needed),
create a folder for the documentation (if it doesn't already exist)
called docs:

.. code-block:: text

  cd
  cd <PROJECT_NAME>
  mkdir docs
  cd docs

Run the sphinx-quickstart script in the docs folder of the project to do the
one-time set-up for the project:

.. code-block:: text

  sphinx-quickstart
