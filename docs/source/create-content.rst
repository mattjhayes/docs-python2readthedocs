You can, and should, create some documentation about your project in
addition to the auto-generated module documentation.

Here are some basic pointers on how to create documentation pages in
reStructuredText.

Conventions

Line length
===========

The length of a line in reStructuredText shouldn't be more than 79 characters

Headings
========

Headings are:

H1
--

# with overline. There should only one H1 in the document. Example:

.. code-block:: text

  ###############
  Heading Level 1
  ###############

H2    * with overline
H3    =
H4    -
H5    ^
H6    "

TBD
